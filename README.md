status
------

This project is in an early development stage and will propably not do
anything useful yet.  When it becomes usable, I will try to merge it
into the existing [Text::vCard](https://github.com/ranguard/text-vcard)
distribution - otherwise it will be offered as a standalone module.


what
----

vCard-Compare contains code to compare two ``vCard::AddressBook`` or
``Text::vCard::Addressbook`` and list the vCards contained in only the
first, only the second or both address books separately (like
``List::Compare`` does).  The comparison strategy can be changed, by
default the full name in the vCards will be compared.

vCard-Compare also contains code to compare two single ``vCard`` or
``Text::vCard`` in the same fashion.

This should enable you to build a custom merge-scheme two vCard
address books.

why
---

I have a set of very old (>15y) Perl scripts to handle my personal
address book based on a custom text format.  I want to connect this
address book to my smartphone, so I need to connect my custom scripts
to a vCard file storage and that's what this project is part of.

For this purpose I also work on
[vCard-vDir](https://github.com/mmitch/vcard-vdir) to convert between
a single-file address book and the multifile vdir style that is
generated by [vdirsyncer](https://vdirsyncer.pimutils.org/en/stable/).

As I just code blindly and see where this takes me (finishing this
project is by no means urgent), I might come up with other projects,
most likely something like ``vcard-merge''.


build and installation
----------------------

To build and install the current development version of vCard-Compare,
you need to have Dist::Zilla installed.  Run the ``dzil`` command - if
it is available, Dist::Zilla should be installed.

To install or upgrade Dist::Zilla use

    $ cpan -i Dist::Zilla

or

    $ cpanm Dist::Zilla

Then clone this repository, enter it and start the install process:

    $ git clone https://github.com/mmitch/vcard-compare.git
	$ cd vcard-compare
    $ dzil install

Any missing dependencies should be reported automatically and can be
installed by

    $ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
	$ dzil listdeps --missing | cpanm

Afterwards, try the installation again with

    $ dzil install
